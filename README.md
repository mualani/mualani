i hang out on pt. i usually sit on the global safe server, or on russian server #1
<br>
i sit in the danganronpa/hoyoverse area or wherever my friends are sitting at
<br>
unlike a majority of the pt playerbase im pretty social so interacting is alright
<br>
<br>
**idle**: i'm off-tab, so please whisper me - **busy**: you're welcome to speak to me
<br>
in public chat; busy is my default status. i also have lf chat enabled sometimes
<br>
<br>
i dont care who interacts with me anymore. just dont be weird ok? thank you
