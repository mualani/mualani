im 14 years old, pony #6. i dont understand how you drew the conclusion that im college student
<br> aged based off me speaking in a mature way; i wasnt "picking fights" either. the person i spoke to
<br> had phrased their words (to me, by the way) rather impolitely. i was responding to the rudeness
